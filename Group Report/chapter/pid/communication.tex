\newthought{The various stakeholders of the project} that have been identified are shown in table \ref{tab:stakeholders} below. The relationship between the stakeholder and the project is shown, along with a rough estimate of their power and interest.\sidenote[][-4em]{See \bibentry{mendelow1991stakeholder}} This grid will form a reference for making sure that all interested parties are communicated with appropriately.

\noindent Communication within the team is examined in detail elsewhere in this document, so the remainder of this section is concerned with the other stakeholders.

\subsection{Supervisor Meetings}

Regular communication with our supervisor is likely to be a critical factor in success of the project. For this reason a weekly meeting with at least on member of the group if not more should be high priority.

\subsection{Client Meetings}

\subsection{Projects Organiser and Second Assessor}

The projects organiser could exert a strong influence over the project if they wished, but as there are many projects and it would be inappropriate for them to demonstrate partiality, extended levels of communication are unlikely to be necessary. Brief updates pertaining to deliverables is all that should be required. But if the project organiser initiates communication then they should be made a high priority.

Communication with the second accessor is, for the most part, not appropriate, excepting when within the remit of the deliverables, ie the report and presentation themselves.
