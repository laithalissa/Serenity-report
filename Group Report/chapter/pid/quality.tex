\subsection{Continuous Integration}

Unit tests are only really useful if they are run regularly. Doing so allows developers
to catch bugs as soon as they are introduced. This is useful because, as van Emden
and Moonen note, the cost of fixing a bug is much lower if it is discovered earlier in
the development cycle.\cite{emden2002} Therefore, a continuous integration server
will be used to perform a full build and test of the software every time a new change
is pushed to the source control repository.
