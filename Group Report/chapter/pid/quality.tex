\subsection{Unit Testing}

Unit tests are used to test small, individual units of source code and ensure that the
code meets its intended design. Unit testing is a very useful practice because it helps
catch errors in code and allows a developer to refactor code by ensuring that it continues
to work as before.

\subsection{Component Testing}

Component testing is similar to unit testing, but focuses on larger pieces of the source
code; it is used to test the integration of a number of units. Component is useful to
ensure that the small units of code, which, through unit testing, are known to work
individually, work together correctly.

\subsection{Continuous Integration}

Unit tests are only really useful if they are run regularly. Doing so allows developers
to catch bugs as soon as they are introduced. This is useful because, as van Emden
and Moonen note, the cost of fixing a bug is much lower if it is discovered earlier in
the development cycle.\cite{emden2002} Therefore, a continuous integration server
will be used to perform a full build and test of the software every time a new change
is pushed to the source control repository.
