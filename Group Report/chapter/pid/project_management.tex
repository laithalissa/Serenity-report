\newthought{Project management} is often incorrectly considered to be the coordination of steps a project must move through to be completed on time, the real challenge of project management is constantly incorporating the requirements of the customer into an ever changing system to ensure that the progression of the project is always in the customers interest. A major concern of project management is to minimise wasted time and resources without compromising the quality of the project, wasting time on this project would result in a poorer quality product.

\section{Agile Methodology and Weekly Releases}
The project team has adopted the agile development methodology, the project is broken down into smaller increments which require minimal planning and are unlikely to require long term consideration. Development iterations allow the team to regularly deliver working software, reducing the likelihood of delays going unnoticed and becoming obstructions at a later stage. The development cycle the team has selected requires a component release every Tuesday evening, making each iteration span exactly one week. Each release should include the latest completed iteration of the project, the first milestone will be the game prototype which is scheduled for release on 27th November 2012, further milestones include: beta, and finally the release candidate by 19th March 2013.

The team has readily adopted pair programming, as well as test-driven development and continuous integration to help maintain code stability through multiple iterations, techniques which are strong advocates of the agile development methodology.

There are aspects to development cycles beyond the milestones and time scheduling, programmer welfare is a large focus of agile development strategies. Ensuring programmers are not overworked or lose interest in the project is an emergent factor in maintaining quality in software projects, and although the team and project managers cannot realistically limit the hours a team member spends programming over a week (mainly due to other programming assignments in parallel to the project), Wednesday afternoons and weekends have been avoided in the weekly timetable to guarantee personal time every week.


\subsection{Standup Meetings}
Standup meetings are held every week to discuss individual progress on the project, any issues an individual has been encountered, and what they will attempt to accomplish in the following week.

\section{Change Management}
As the project develops new ideas and approaches may become apparent, care must be taken to avoid blindly integrating changes into the original specification to protect the project from scope creep. The change management procedure involves assessing the viability and benefits of the change request, deciding whether the change would stop the project meeting the requirements, and if so, whether the customer and managers can reach an agreement which incorporates this change into the project or whether the change request should be rejected. Change viability is decided on the difference in cost and time required, whereas the requirements assessment is heavily dependant on the customer, and whether they think such a change would prevent the project meeting their requirements.
