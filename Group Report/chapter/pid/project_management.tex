Our project team has adopted the agile development cycle as a basis for our management structure. We've broken the project down into critical components and have committed to weekly releases to ensure the project remains well scheduled throughout the project lifetime.

\section{Weekly Releases}
As a motivating factor to keep the project on schedule we've committed to component releases every Tuesday evening. The release should include the latest completed iteration of the project, which is scheduled to develop as a prototype by the end of term 1.

\section{Standup Meetings}
Standup meetings are held every week to discuss individual progress on the project, any issues an individual has been encountered, and what they will attempt to accomplish in the following week.
