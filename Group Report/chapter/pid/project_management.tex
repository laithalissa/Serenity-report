Our project team has adopted athe agile development cycle as a basis for our management structure. We've broken the project down into critical componenets and have commited to weekly releases to ensure the project remains well scheduled throught the project lifetime.

\section{Risk Management}
Unexpected delays need to be anticipated and dealt with promptly, although risks present themselves in different forms, the ultimate cost of delays is the loss of time which can prove disasterous to precariously scheduled projects. Our project schedule anticipates delays by including feed buffers between components of the project for dealing with small delays without suffering the overhead of returning to complete the task at a later stage. In addition to feed buffers our schedule has allocated a project buffer, a reserve of time allocated to optional components (such as extended gameplay modes) which can be reallocated to deal with major delays.
