\section{Functional Requirements}

% what it is 
% what it will be used for
% how we will measure success

\begin{enumerate}

\item AI:
The AI, artificial Intelligence will include any algorithms under the field of Artificial Intelligence, such as planning.
The Player's fleet will be controlled by an AI algorim. It will use a planning algorithm that takes a high level objective given by the player, and generates a series of steps to achieve that objective.
The measurement of success for AI is being able to give an order to a ship that requires at least 3 sub steps to achieve that goal, and the AI successfully completing that goal(assuming it is possible to achieve this goal).
When an AI is given a goal that is either impossible to achieve given the world state, or is later invalidated due to world changing before the goal is achieved, the goal will be canceled, and the AI will wait for the next goal assigned by the player.

\item Realtime Strategy:


\item Multiplayer:
Multiplayer is a game which two human players can participate in, interacting with each other within the game world.
For this specific game, both players will be operating different computers on the same Network.
The network requirements are that it is a Local Area Network, allowing much greating bandwidths than the World Wide Web.

\item Ship Design:


\item Resource System:

\item Planetary Capture:

\item Campaign Style Multiplayer:

\item Tactical Zoom:

\item Fog Of War:

\item Operating System Requirements:
Mac OS or Linux(kernel 2.6 or later) 

\item Haskell:

\end{enumerate}
