\begin{description}

	\item[AI] 
The AI, artificial Intelligence will include any algorithms under the field of Artificial Intelligence, such as planning.
The Player's fleet will be controlled by an AI algorim. It will use a planning algorithm that takes a high level objective given by the player, and generates a series of steps to achieve that objective.
The measurement of success for AI is being able to give an order to a ship that requires at least 3 sub steps to achieve that goal, and the AI successfully completing that goal(assuming it is possible to achieve this goal).
When an AI is given a goal that is either impossible to achieve given the world state, or is later invalidated due to world changing before the goal is achieved, the goal will be canceled, and the AI will wait for the next goal assigned by the player.
The AI will be required to control single ships within the fleet, never the fleet itself, since a human player is always in control of a fleet.

\item[Realtime Strategy]


\item[Multiplayer]
Multiplayer is a game which two human players can participate in, interacting with each other within the game world.
For this specific game, both players will be operating different computers on the same Network.
The network requirements are that it is a Local Area Network, allowing much greating bandwidths than the World Wide Web.

\item[Campaign]
The gameplay will consist of a fixed number of battles between the two players, will a penultimate final battle to determine the winner.
The winner of each battle, will be granted a bonus in the final battle, giving them an advantage against their opponent.

\item[Fleet Customization]



\item[Resource System]

\item[Planetary Capture]

\item[Tactical Zoom]

\item[Fog Of War]

\item[Operating System Requirements]
Mac OS or Linux(kernel 2.6 or later) 

\item[Haskell]
