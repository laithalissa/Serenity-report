% legal
One potential legal issue faced by this project is the use of third party software.
It must be ensured that any third party libraries included in the code are licensed
appropriately. This means only using software with a permissive license (e.g. Apache, BSD, or MIT licenses) and no proprietary software.

Game publishers such as Electronic Arts, and Lion Head, consider their games as intelligectual property, copywriting their games.
It is infeasable to check that all previous games published don't bear great similarities which would result in a court case.
