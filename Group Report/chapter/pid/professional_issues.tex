% legal
One potential legal issue faced by this project is the use of third party software.
It must be ensured that any third party libraries included in the code are licensed
appropriately. This means only using software with a permissive license (e.g. Apache, BSD, or MIT licenses) and no proprietary software.

Game publishers such as Electronic Arts, and Lion Head, consider their games as intelliectual property and copyright their games.
It is infeasible to check that all previous games published do not bear great similarities which could result in a court case.

% ethical
Games can be highly addictive, resulting in their players investing many hours into the game.
If the game is pay-to-play, this can also result in large sums of money invested into the game.
The game being developed uses a fixed length campaign of 5 battles, resulting in convenient game play periods for the user to quit the game.  

% social issues
The game is based in a fictional world, with a non-realistic graphical representation of this world. Current issues with games, such as racism, and violence are not an issue with this game.

The game will only support the english language.
This prevents users from using the game who cannot read english.
