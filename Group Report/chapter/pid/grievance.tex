\section{Grievance Policy}
It's imperative to document a grievance guideline to ensure that any grievance procedures are fair and impartial. %ref gov
 Because the developer team is small, an internal dispute would have a high cost to the project, so grievance issues need to be dealt with promptly. 
  
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
    \item{Attempt to resolve the grievance issue informally by the team manager.}
    \item{If the issue cannot be resolved informally, and affects the entire project group, then address the issue at the next meeting and attempt to find a resolution in a group environment.}
    \item{If the issue cannot be solved by a formal group meeting then a managerial confrontation is required to reduce the impact on the project.}
    \item{If the issue still cannot be resolved then a complaint should be made to the module supervisor and university procedure should be followed from then on.}
\end{enumerate}
