	\vspace{1em}\noindent{\it Abstract\ \ } A full multiplayer strategy game --- designed to be competitive in the current independent game market --- was developed and implemented exclusively using the Haskell language, with the goal of evaluating the efficacy of Haskell for development of this nature. Haskell was shown to be quite effective in this space, despite the pure functional nature of the language and the comparative lack of library support in the domain of games. Full details of the strengths and challenges of this approach are reported on herein, and a set of best practices for the use of Haskell in games development are suggested.
