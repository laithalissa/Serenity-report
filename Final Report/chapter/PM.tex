\chapterepigraph{Planning is an unnatural process. It is much more satisfying to do something and the nicest thing about not planning is that failure comes as a complete surprise rather than being preceded by a long period of worry and depression.}{Sir John Harvey, c.1800}

\newthought{Project management} is an essential piece of the software engineering process.
Projects must be managed carefully and correctly because of the budgetary and scheduling
constraints they are subject to. Whilst good management does not guarantee the success of
a project, badly managed projects will usually result in failure.

This chapter will discuss the project management techniques used during this project.
It aims to lay out what was planned to help the project be completed successfully, why
these methods where chosen, and how useful they were.
