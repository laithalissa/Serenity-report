\chapter{Acknowledgements}

\begin{fullwidth}

The project team would like to thank Sara Kalvala and Matt Leeke for their excellent supervision of, and input into, the project. Thanks also to the maintainers of the \emph{Gloss} library, especially Ben Lippmeier and Thomas DuBuisson who responded to and fixed a space leak bug that was reported by the team during the course of the project; Ertugrul S\"oylemez for the \emph{Netwire} library; and Professor Steve Matthews for the effort involved in organising and directing all of the fourth year projects. Finally, a big thank you to Warwick Security for being sympathetic to our idiosyncratic schedules in the department's computer labs, and the staff at the Caf\'e Library for the vital supply of high quality caffeine.
