\chapterepigraph{Advances in technology won't be as significant as they have been in the past, most games won't be materially improved by simulating every drop of water in the pond you are wading through. More resources can be profitably spent to make the creation process easier.}{John Carmack}

\newthought{Functional programming} (FP) has a long history, with its roots in the $\lambda$-calculus of Alonzo Church.\citefix[-1.5em]{church1932} One of the first functional programming languages was Lisp, invented by John McCarthy in 1958, which is still used today, over 50 years later.\citepage{reilly2003}{pages 156--157} Various languages have refined and extended the functional paradigm over the years --- probably the most notable as of now being Haskell, Scala, OCaml, F\#, and Erlang.
