\chapterepigraph{The designer of a new system must not only be the implementor and the first 
large-scale user; the designer should also write the first user manual\ldots 
If I had not participated fully in all these activities, 
literally hundreds of improvements would never have been made, 
because I would never have thought of them or perceived 
why they were important.
