\section{Rendering the Game}
This section covers 2 aspects: How the world is rendered through a view port, and the parallax effect.

% view port
% TODO view port
The view port is like a mapping from the window on the screen to the game world.
It shows a small rectangle of the game world in the window on the screen.
The view port into the game world can be moved around the game world showing different parts, or it can be resizes showing more or less detail of the game world.

This is achieved through transformations of the game world image, more specifically translation and scaling.

% TODO parallax effect
% TODO  assets dynamically assigned color
