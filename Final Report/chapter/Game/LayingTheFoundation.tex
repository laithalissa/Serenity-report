  what to do what to do what to do.
  In this section should talk about what we did for our infrastructure, what decisions we made, what we thought we would need to factor in later on.
  
things to talk about:
  - terminology
  - realizing what was needed for alpha stage.
  - researching libraries that could be used

\section{Laying The Foundation}

Terminology was the first step in the conversion process from specification to working game. 
An initial ambiguity was that many of haskell libraries being looked into had a concept of 'world' which varied dramatically, which in term caused every member of the team to have a different meaning for the word. This caused many misunderstandings until an internal terminaology was devised within the team to describe common terms such as 'client state'. Once the terminology hurdle was solved, The team was able to share design ideas efficiently.

By the end of alpha Stage a working 'game' was needed, somethat that could be used as a base to start adding game features.

The infrastructure must provide a platform that the game features can be implemented ontop of, Hence it must contain:
\begin{itemize}
\item Server-Client communication
\item Rendering capabilities for assets
\item Game loop
\item Model of game components
\end{itemize}

Mistakes at this stage will cost heavily later down the line, because so much will dependend on the infrastructure.
