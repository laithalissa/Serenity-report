\section{Ships, Spacelanes, and Path Finding}

The specification made it clear --- by the way weapons and navigation between planets was to be structured --- that ship motion needed to be relatively detailed. It is no use having a weapon that can be only used in one arc if ships could instantly pivot on the spot. Instead it was desired for ships to move as large objects with a great deal of momentum, with large turning circles and ponderous movements. However it would be undesirable for the motion of ships to be too realistic, as it would make the game needlessly difficult and confusing. A real object undergoing acceleration in space could of course, accelerate essentially indefinitely (until it was nearing the speed of light) but would need to take an equal amount of time to decelerate to stop again.

Intimately related to these questions is the precise nature of the spacelane mechanics. Many different models were discussed for this during design meetings. Initial ideas on the physical mechanism of the spacelane was that they conferred an additional optional acceleration: i.e. that if a ship is proximate to a lane it could opt to undergo greater acceleration than a ship far from a lane. But as mentioned, accurately modelling acceleration in space is somewhat contrary to the gameplay aspirations of the design. 

A simpler mechanics for ships that was agreed to be more suitable is for them to have a top speed that they could reach relatively quickly, but for them to still have large turning circles. This makes their motion more similar to naval ships engaged in warfare. The interpretation of the spacelane in this model cannot be simply a gain in acceleration as this confers little benefit. Instead it is clear that the spacelane must confer an addition to top speed. A possible physical interpretation of these behaviours is that the ships are moving in some kind of ether with friction, and so will reach a terminal velocity. The spacelane is then an area with an  artificially induced lower density of ether.

Another fundamental question about the nature of the spacelane is whether its effects are immediately felt at full strength at a certain distance from it, or whether they fall off related to distance. the former is most definitely simpler, but the latter feels more natural as a mechanism. Figure~\ref{fig:spacelanes} shows the difference in the shortest paths that these approachs may generate, discounting the additional issue of ship turning.
