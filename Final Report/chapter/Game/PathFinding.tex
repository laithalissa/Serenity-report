how navigation works on a map with planets and space lanes.

- A*
making the ship follow path more naturally:
- bezier
- fluid flow

% what pathfinding is
Pathfinding is used by the ships to find a path to a given destination that has the smallest travel time.
The map has space lanes that the ships can use to travel between planets very fast.

When a ship is required to move to a given position, A path to the destination must be calcuated which is optimal or at least a close approximation to optimal.
A space lane provides a speed boost multiplier to the ship's speed. For example:
$$ Ship's speed 2 $$
$$ Ship's destination has a distance of 8 from its current location $$
