The resources represent the currency of the game. The player's access to resources can dramatically effect hit chances of winning a battle.

Each resources has a unique purpose in the game, requiring the player to change strategy depending on the type and quantity of resources the player has access to.

The three resources are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fuel
\item Metal
\item Anti-Matter
\end{itemize}

% describe how their are gained (from planets)
Each planet on the map will have a supply of resources. 
The quantity of resources on each planet will vary, but will relate to the planet's type.
When that planet is captured, it will provide a constant trickle of its resources to the player.
For instance if a planet has the following resources:
\begin{description}
\item[Fuel]: 1
\item[Metal]: 2
\item[Anti-Matter]: 0
\end{description}
And is captured by player 1, then every minute, they will receive 2 metal from the planet, and 1 fuel. 
The planet will continue to supply the player with resources until the game ends or another player captures the planet.

% describe how the ship has access to the resources
Each ship will have its own cache of resources on board.
When the ship is near one of it's planets, It will have access to resupply from the player's stockpile. The ship's resource cache will automatically refill when near the player's planets. 
Larger class ships have bigger resource caches, and therefore can last longer before needing to resupply (subject to resource consumption).

When a group of ships leaves the safety of its own planets, and starts entering battles, their resource supplies will eventually become empty unless they return to one of their planets. 
If the group of ships continue to battle without resources they will eventually sustain damage to hull and will be more likely to loose the battle.
When a battle takes place within proximately to the player's planet, that player will have the benefit of a constant resupply of resources to the ships in battle. For the other player to win that battle they would need to do so before ship's resources start to dwindle.
This gives the defending player the advantage of endurance, being able to last a battle much longer.


\subsection{Fuel}
When a ship's shields are less than 100\%, Fuel is used by the ship to replenish the ship's shields.
The rate that the ship's shields are regenerated is dependent on the ship class, not the quantity of the ship's fuel cache.
If the ship runs out of fuel, it will stop regenerating its shields.

\subsection{Metal}
When a ship's hull takes damage, the ship is able to repair it on the go with the use of Metal onboard.
The ship will continue to drain it's supply of metal repairing the ship until it has full health again or its metal cache runs out.

\subsection{Anti-Matter}
The rarest of resources, is used as ammunition for a ship's most powerful weapons.
These weapons can only fire if the ship has Anti-Matter on board.
This reason can easilly swap the tide in battle.
