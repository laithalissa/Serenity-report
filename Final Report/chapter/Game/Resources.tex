The resources represent the currency of the game. The player's access to resources can dramatically effect hit chances of winning a battle.

Each resouces has a unique purpose in the game, requiring the player to change strategy dependending on the type and quantity of resources the player has access to.

The three resources are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fuel
\item Metal
\item Anti-Matter
\end{itemize}

% describe how their are gained (from planets)
Each planet on the map will have a supply of resources. 
The quantity of resources on each planet will vary, but will relate to the planet's type.
When that planet is captured, it will provide a constant trickle of its resources to the player.
For instance if a planet has the following resources:
\begin{description}
\item[Fuel]: 1
\item[Metal]: 2
\item[Anti-Matter]: 0
\end{description}
And is captured by player 1, then every minute, they will receive 2 metal from the planet, and 1 fuel. 
The planet will continue to supply the player with resources until the game ends or another player captures the planet.


		different planets have different quantities of each resource.
		planets are resource generators, every minute they generate a specific amount of each resource.
		each player has a Fuel/AM/Metal value that is added to their global resource values.

		every ship carries their own supply of F/AM/M which is constantly resupplied own the player's planet graph.
		when exploring/attacking the ships will no longer be on the player's plenet graph hence they will start to eat through the ships resource capacity.

		when a ship is on the player's planet graph they start to resupply draining the player's global resources.





Three resources exist within the game: fuel, metal, and anti-matter. These resources are only used by the ships. Fuel maintains a ship’s shields, without a shield any damage will be done to the ship’s hull. Metal is used to slowly repair a ship’s hull after it has been damaged. Anti-matter is a rare resource that is used by the more powerful weapons available.Planets generate a constant supply of resources, so players can gain extra resources via planetary capture. The resources gen- erated by the planets owned by a player feed into that player’s global stockpile. Individual ships then draw resources from this stockpile.
