% topology of network(star diagram, what server does, what client does)

	\label{fig:serverClientSychNetworkTopology}
\end{marginfigure}

The topology is a typical Star Network, with server in centre, and all clients only connecting to server.
There are $N+1$ player connected, where client 0 is the client that is hosting the server.
Since client 0 is hosting the server, they have special permissions to stop the server at any point, ending the game.
This topology greatly simplifies the requirements of the networking, because every client has to only connect to server, and receive all its updates from 1 single place. 

% protocol for synching game states between client server (command, update)
Figure \ref{fig:loops} gives a good representation how the server and a given client communicate.
When the player gives an order, i.e. to move a ship to a given destination, that order is sent to the server in the form of a command.
On the server side, that command is used to 'update' the server's game model. Now the server's game state is at a later version than the clients. The server generates updates that can be applied to all client's game states to bring them to the same version as the server's version.

% network traffic calculation
Both the server and client have a full copy of the model representing the game state. 
The benefit of this was that it allowed the clients to scroll around the map without requiring any network traffic.
Their were concerns that the volume of traffic required to maintain all the client's game states updates would be too great for a playable game.
Therefore a traffic analysis was done to estimate how much network traffic would actually be required.
The assumptions with regards to number of ships, amount of updates will be a worse case scenario. 
If the network has the bandwidth for the heuristic from this calculation, then the network will not be a limiting factor for the majority of games.

constants for calculation:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
    \hline
    Constant & Value \\ \hline
    frame rate & 33 \\ 
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}



A few constants were assumed to simplify calculation:
$$ updates / second = 30 $$
$$ \#ships = 40 $$

The next step was to calculate the size of a ship update message.

Hence a single ship movement update message would be:
$$ size = (shipID, x, y, directionX, directionY, hullHealth) = 5 * 4 bytes = 20 bytes $$
To send a single ship update to a single client is 20 bytes.



			world updates per second 30
			ships in world = 40
			bullets in world = 1000
			ship movement update = (shipId, x, y, direction) = 4 * 4bytes = 16 bytes.
			bullet movement update = (bulletId, x, y, direction) = 4 * 4bytes = 16bytes
			per client:
				per update:
 					ship data = 40 * 16bytes = 640bytes
					bullet data = 1000 * 16bytes = 16000bytes
					total data = 16640bytes
			    per second = 30 * 16640 = 499200bytes = 487.5KB/S
			3 clients = 3 * 487.5KB/s = 1462.5KB/s = 1.43MB/s

\begin{comment}

This section talks about how multiplayer was achieved.
This includes the network topology.
server-client allows master copy to exist on server.

- master copy of world on server
- clients perform no logic, only apply updates to
- 




----------------------------------- old gay -----------------------------------------

we need to work out how the computers talked to each other very early on
2 considerations: peer 2 peer, client-server
  - advantages of peer 2 peer
  - advantages of peer server-client
  - why server-client chosen 
  - issues experienced with server-client
    - jumpy ship movements

The game was designed around being multiplayer, so our first goal was to decide how the player's computers would talk to each other.
Since their was an arbitrary number of players (greater than 1), We needed a system that would scale, but would also be robust.
The game was expecting all players to be on the same LAN (Local Area Network), hence a high bandwidth was available for the communications.

There are 3 strategies for the interactions between computers:
\begin{itemize}
\item \stepOneName
\item \stepTwoName
\item \stepThreeName
\end{itemize}


\begin{marginfigure}

	\caption{
	\stepOneName : 4 clients connected. client 1 has just modified its game state, so it send the update to all other clients.
	}
	\label{fig:serverClientSychP2P}
\end{marginfigure}

% what
\stepOneName is a peer to peer strategy, in which each computer has a full model of the game. Figure \ref{fig:serverClientSychP2P} shows an example of this strategy. 
Their are 4 computers within game. Each client (client 1, client 2, client 3, and client4) have a full copy of the game.
When client 1 updates performs some actions, they must update their game state, and send this update to all other clients.

\end{marginfigure}

% advantages
%   playable with slow networks
This strategy means players can continue to play games on networks with high latency, without any lag. When packets are delayed, the client can continue to play the game, and the game is updated when the packet arrives.
%   no dedicated server required
No client is picked to act as server, which causes game to end if that selected client disconnects.
Since all clients act as server, any client can disconnect and the game continues, providing more robustness which is highly desirable for games with long game intervals, such as Civilization series\cite{civilizationInMyPants}.



% disadvantages
%   disynchronization
Maintaining synchronisation when using a peer-2-peer protocol can be very challenging from a technical point of view, with non-determinism being caused by messages being received by clients at different times causing race conditions.
When this happens in a game, it can cause clients game states to desynchronise.
For example, In Figure \ref{fig:serverClientDesync}, there are 2 clients.
%   corrupted client can effect the entire game



% res/computer_communication_architecture




% lockstep
%   - each client has the master copy of the world
%   - when a client does something, it tells all others
%   - problems:
%     - desycnhronization
%     - currupted client fucks up everyone

% simple server client
%   - it's what we've implemented
%   - no simulation on clients
%   - 1 server that has master copy
%   - server does all processing and sends updates to clients
%   - clients just render the world and send commands to server

% server client with simulation
%   - similar to simple server client but client does 'some' simulation. They in no way can effect the world.
%   - for instance if client knows ships destination and current location it can render the ship graciously moving instead of jumping on every update.
