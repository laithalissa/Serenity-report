\section[On the Separation of Interface from Implementation and Cause from Effect]{On the Separation of Interface from Implementation and Cause from Effect}

There has already been some discussion about separating pure code and code that must interact with the outside world in Section \ref{sec:architecture}, and on reducing dependancy between components in Section \ref{sec:encapsulation}. Here we discuss more specific design patterns that can address these and similar issues, in the more general setting of separation between interface and implementation.
