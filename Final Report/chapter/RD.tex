\chapterepigraph{A game is a series of interesting choices.}{Sid Meier}

\newthought{Prior to undertaking} the main planning and development phases of the project the team embarked on a series of pilot projects, and research into the games industry and functional programming. This initial research and development was done to explore some different concepts for interesting games as well as building some familiarity with game development in Haskell. Two literature reviews were also performed. The first was aimed and looking into existing literature on the suitability of FP for practical software development in the real world with an eye for game development in particular. The second review took a look at the current state of the games industry and the processes involved in designing and creating a game. Finally the project team drew on this research to design a game concept to develop. A full specification of the functional and non-functional requirements was drawn up to help guide the development of the game. This chapter presents all of this research, development, and specification work in detail.
