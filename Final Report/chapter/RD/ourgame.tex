\section{Literature Review: Designing a Game for 2013}
\label{sec:litRevDesigningGame}

Making a game successful largely depends on make the game fun to play, but since fun is an entirely subjective measurement, the success can also be measured on the criteria for existing successful games. By analysing best selling games and determining the components which make them best selling, a list of criteria can be formalised to guide development and later assess the success of the project.

Academic literature researching game development is unsurprisingly scarce, so the literature review in this section investigates a number of game industry experts and relates the criteria to the project.

\item[Originality] Francis and Kramer both assert that a successful game should have some original content such as a unique storyline, an unusual physics engine, new weapon concepts, or anything which pulls away from conventional games and adds a new dimension to gaming. If a game is has little originality then it risks becoming dull and uninteresting since it will appear to be a combination of existing game features instead of offering a new concept to the gaming community.\cite{tomfrancis} \cite{wolfgangkramer} 

\item[Replayability] Temba highlights the need to for the gameing experience to be fuelled by lots of active events, where the player can make choices to influence the outcome. Kramer echoes this view by expressing the need for a unique gaming experience developed by the engineering of the game itself. \cite{antontemba} \cite{wolfgangkramer} Many approachable solutions to constructing a unique gaming experience include procedurally generated, randomly offering \emph{superweapons} or providing bonus upgrades to losing players (temporary invulnerability, invisibility etc), all of which add an element of randomness to gameplay to make games more exciting.

\item[Surprises] Hidden features, key events and tactical exploits which are not immediately apparent, rewards those who spend more time playing and learning about the game. A typical consequence of a well structured game is to have different possible outcomes for each possible decision. This is a rather typical pattern found in games such as Unreal Tournament, where a players weapon arsenal might allow him to fend off foes competing for an objective.

\item[Equal opportunity]
Ensuring that no human player has a distinct advantage over any other player, such imbalances could be caused by advantageous starting positions, unequal starting budgets, unbalanced construction options, different health capacities etc. Clearly, different games have different requirements for fulfilling equal opportunity, but one of the most important requirements of a multiplayer game is to give every player an equal chance to win the game from the starting point.

\item[No early elimination]
No player should lose hope of winning early in the game. In the event of poor playing in the start of the game, a player should be able to redeem themselves to regain a chance of winning the game, in this context it's acceptable for the game to \emph{help} a player (e.g. spawning health boosts near the player, or having the AI teams primarily target other players.

\item[Low waiting times]
Players are interested in being involved with a game and don't want to endure period of low activity. This was a common problem in early real-time-strategy games such as Age of Empires, where a player would spend significant time in the ``setting up'' phase.

The recent most popular games over the last few years have been first person shooters, hack and slash, FIFA and  Fitness/Dance games. Unsurprisingly these games are of genres which are frequently published by gaming industry giants, implying they're significantly more profitable than other genres, which in turn implies that such genres are also more popular. This makes designing a new game concept challenging, since there's an immediate bias towards a genre which shows promise for sustaining development and producing sequel games, and has the largest player base. 

This project intends to challenge the conventional genre space by aiming to produce a real time strategy game. The RTS genre has given rise to some extremely popular productions in the early day of gaming corporations such as Total Annihilation, Supreme Commander and the Command and Conquer franchise. Early games lacked sophisticated hardware and game engines, so there was a large focus on developing the gameplay experience, which is likely why these games are so iconic. Since time frame and budget of the project is limited by time and resources, it seems that a simple RTS game would be prudent genre for the game.
