Equal opportuniity is a concept which applies to groups of human players within the game, and it ensures that no player has a distinct advantage over the others from starting locaiton, starting budget, construction options, health limits etc. Clearly different games have different requirements for fulfilling equal opportunity, but the main purpose is to ensure the game never favours a particular player....

\subsection*{No early elimination}
No player should lose hope of winning early in the game, there should be ways to redeem initial poor progress, in this manor it's acceptable for the game to \emph{help} a player avoiding an impending elimination.....

\subsection*{Low waiting times}
Players are interested in being involved with a game and don't want to endure period of low activity, common to early real-time-strategy games....
