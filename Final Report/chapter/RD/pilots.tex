\section{Pilot Projects: Moon Survival, Conway's Game of Life, and SpaceTime}

% Descriptions of pilot projects.

To make an initial assessment on the feasibility of the project and to gain some insight into both technical design and the style of game to be made, several individual pilot projects were undertaken. Reported on here is \emph{Moon Survival}, which was written in Python; a Haskell implementation of Conway's Game of Life;\cite{gardner1970mathematical} and \emph{SpaceTime}, a game based on time travel and written in Haskell.
